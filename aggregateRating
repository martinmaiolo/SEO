Better ng vegetarian I always had this doubt of good food but they provide superb and amazing quality food and that’s not it
A such an altitude where we won’t even get water to drink we would get food like almost atleast 4 times a day ( freshly cooked not packaged )

Being a first timer and beginner in trekking we could complete it with utmost ease

The guide and the staff is amazing

I was in constant touch with Kuldeep ji and right from our pick up from Dehradun station and drop to.Dehradun station we did not feel uncomfortable or anything

It was the best experience

Also when we went there were many trekeking groups which were closed due to government regulations for their problems

But Himalayan Hikers have their own property and you can totally rely on them"
